### ðŸ”¹ Challenge 4: **Countdown Timer** (While Loop + Break)  
Write a program that starts at `10` and counts down to `1`, but if the user enters `"stop"`, the countdown should break.  

**Example:**  
```
10  
9  
8  
Enter "stop" to cancel or press Enter:  
7  
6  
Enter "stop" to cancel or press Enter: stop  
Countdown stopped!
```

ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** Use `input()` inside the loop and check if the user entered `"stop"`.
