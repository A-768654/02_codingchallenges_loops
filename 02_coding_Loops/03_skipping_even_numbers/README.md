### ðŸ”¹ Challenge 3: **Skipping Even Numbers** (For Loop + Continue)  
Write a program that prints numbers from `1` to `10`, but **skips even numbers** using the `continue` statement.  

**Example Output:**  
```
1  
3  
5  
7  
9  
```

ðŸ’¡ **Hint:** Use an `if` condition to check if a number is even (`num % 2 == 0`).  

---

**Pseudocode:**
1. Start
2. Import time
3. Loop through numbers 1-10
4. Check if number has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2
5. Continue = skips the rest of the statement and moves on to next interation (ChatGPT)
6. Print numbers
7. Wait one second before the next number
8. End
